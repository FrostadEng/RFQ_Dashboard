# Spec Summary (Lite)

Simplify RFQ crawler by removing ZIP file support and treating Sent/Received folders identically (folder-based only). Update UI with dark mode default and clickable project number that opens folder in file explorer. Unify transmissions and receipts into single `submissions` collection with `type` field ("sent"/"received"). Update mock projects and dashboard to display simplified structure, supporting multiple sent/received exchanges per supplier for tracking ongoing negotiations.
