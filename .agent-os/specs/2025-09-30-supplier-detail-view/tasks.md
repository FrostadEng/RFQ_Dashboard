These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-supplier-detail-view/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-30
> Status: ✅ Completed

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Implement database queries and caching for supplier data
  - [x] 1.1 Create fetch_supplier_data() function with @st.cache_data decorator (TTL=300s)
  - [x] 1.2 Implement supplier query sorted alphabetically by supplier_name
  - [x] 1.3 Implement transmissions query sorted by sent_date descending
  - [x] 1.4 Implement receipts query sorted by received_date descending
  - [x] 1.5 Add error handling for database query failures
  - [x] 1.6 Verify caching works correctly and data loads efficiently

- [x] 2. Build supplier section display with expandable layout
  - [x] 2.1 Replace placeholder content area with supplier data rendering
  - [x] 2.2 Create st.expander for each supplier with 🏢 icon and supplier name
  - [x] 2.3 Implement auto-expand logic for first supplier (expanded=True if index==0)
  - [x] 2.4 Add st.divider() between supplier sections for visual separation
  - [x] 2.5 Implement empty state handling (no suppliers found message)
  - [x] 2.6 Test with projects having multiple suppliers (5+)

- [x] 3. Implement two-column layout for sent/received data
  - [x] 3.1 Create st.columns(2) layout inside each supplier expander
  - [x] 3.2 Add "📤 Sent Transmissions" subheader in left column
  - [x] 3.3 Add "📥 Received Submissions" subheader in right column
  - [x] 3.4 Implement empty state messages for no transmissions/receipts
  - [x] 3.5 Verify columns display side-by-side correctly on various screen sizes

- [x] 4. Display transmission metadata with file access
  - [x] 4.1 Format transmission display with 📦 ZIP name, 📅 date, 📁 file count
  - [x] 4.2 Implement nested expander for source files list (limit first 20, show "...X more")
  - [x] 4.3 Create create_file_link() helper function for file:// protocol links
  - [x] 4.4 Create create_download_button() helper function using st.download_button
  - [x] 4.5 Display [Open] link and [⬇️ Download] button side-by-side for ZIP files
  - [x] 4.6 Display [Open] link and [⬇️ Download] button for each source file
  - [x] 4.7 Test file access on Windows and Linux (different file path formats)

- [x] 5. Implement folder structure parsing and display for receipts
  - [x] 5.1 Create build_folder_tree() function to parse flat file list into nested structure
  - [x] 5.2 Create render_folder_tree() recursive function with indentation and icons (📁/📄)
  - [x] 5.3 Implement folder tree display with proper hierarchy (2 spaces per level)
  - [x] 5.4 Add [Open] link and [⬇️ Download] button for each file in tree
  - [x] 5.5 Handle deeply nested structures (5+ levels) gracefully
  - [x] 5.6 Test with complex folder structures preserving original organization

- [x] 6. Add pagination for large file lists
  - [x] 6.1 Implement pagination logic with threshold (100 files triggers pagination)
  - [x] 6.2 Add st.number_input for page navigation (items_per_page=50)
  - [x] 6.3 Display "Showing X-Y of Z files" count indicator
  - [x] 6.4 Use unique keys per supplier/section to maintain independent pagination
  - [x] 6.5 Test with suppliers having 100+ files to verify pagination works
  - [x] 6.6 Add st.expander for large folders in tree view (collapsible folder summary)

- [x] 7. Error handling, validation, and testing
  - [x] 7.1 Add file path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
  - [x] 7.2 Handle missing file paths gracefully (show ⚠️ warning icon)
  - [x] 7.3 Add try/except blocks for folder tree parsing with fallback to flat list
  - [x] 7.4 Test file:// links work in Chrome, Firefox, Edge browsers
  - [x] 7.5 Test download buttons work for various file types (PDF, ZIP, DOCX, DWG)
  - [x] 7.6 Verify complete workflow: select project → expand supplier → navigate folders → download/open files

## Implementation Summary

**Completed:** 2025-09-30

**Files Modified:**
- `streamlit_dashboard.py` - Extended with complete supplier detail view implementation (590 lines total)

**New Functions Added:**
- `fetch_supplier_data()` - Cached database queries for supplier data
- `create_file_link()` - Platform-specific file:// URL generation
- `create_download_button()` - Streamlit download button helper
- `build_folder_tree()` - Parse flat file list into nested folder structure
- `render_folder_tree()` - Recursive rendering of folder hierarchy

**Key Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Expandable supplier sections (first auto-expanded)
- ✅ Two-column layout (sent transmissions | received submissions)
- ✅ Folder structure preservation with hierarchical tree display
- ✅ Dual file access (file:// links + download buttons)
- ✅ Pagination for large file lists (100+ files)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and empty states

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Dashboard displays supplier data correctly
- ✅ Folder trees render with proper hierarchy
- ✅ File links and download buttons functional
- ✅ Pagination works for large file lists
- ✅ Error handling graceful (fallback to flat list)
- ⚠️ Minor layout adjustments noted by user (tracked for future refinement)

**Next Steps:**
- Run project-manager agent to update roadmap
- Run git-workflow agent to commit changes
- Consider Phase 1.2: Docker Containerization or layout refinements spec
