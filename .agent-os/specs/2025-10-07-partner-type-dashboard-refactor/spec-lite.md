# Spec Summary (Lite)

Refactor the RFQ Dashboard to introduce a "Contractor" partner type alongside the existing "Supplier" type, enabling users to toggle between views and see clearer project-level vs. partner-level statistics. The crawler will detect "Contractor RFQ Quotes" folders to assign partner types, while the UI will display project-wide aggregate stats in a new header, inline sent/received counts in the partner list, and streamlined card layouts for better information hierarchy.
