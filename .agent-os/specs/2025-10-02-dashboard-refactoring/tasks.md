## Implementation Notes

- Follow the exact module structure specified in sub-specs/technical-spec.md
- Use dashboard/ as the main source directory (not src/)
- Each module should import only what it needs
- Panel render functions receive their column and necessary data as parameters
- Session state management remains centralized in app.py
- All existing functionality must work identically after refactoring
- CSS injection and logging configuration stay in app.py
- Maintain all @st.cache_data decorators for performance

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New app.py runs successfully with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] All existing features work identically to original streamlit_dashboard.py
- [ ] Dashboard/ directory structure matches technical spec exactly
- [ ] app.py is lean (~100-150 lines) with no business logic or UI rendering
- [ ] All manual tests pass
- [ ] Original streamlit_dashboard.py can be safely archived
