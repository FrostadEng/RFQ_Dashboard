# Spec Summary (Lite)

Refactor the monolithic streamlit_dashboard.py (1200+ lines) into a modular, scalable project structure with clear separation of concerns (UI, data, logic, utils) while maintaining exact current behavior. The new structure will use app.py as the entry point and organize code into dashboard/ui/, dashboard/data/, dashboard/logic/, and dashboard/utils/ modules, making the codebase more maintainable and enabling faster future development.
