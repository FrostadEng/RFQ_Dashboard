# Spec Summary (Lite)

Redesign the RFQ Dashboard with an improved two-panel layout: left panel for project search, filters, and paginated list (15/page); right panel with hierarchical supplier dropdowns showing Received/Sent columns, date folders, and folder statistics (file count, sizes). Add in-browser PDF preview with back/download buttons. Update crawler and mock data to handle real folder structure: Projects/{project}/1-RFQ/Supplier RFQ Quotes/{supplier}/{Received|Sent}/{date}/file.pdf.
