> Spec: Docker Containerization for RFQ Dashboard
> Created: 2025-09-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Containerize the RFQ Dashboard application using Docker Compose to enable easy deployment and solve MongoDB installation complexity issues. The solution will package the Streamlit application and MongoDB database in containers with proper volume mounts for configuration, project data access, and persistent database storage. The system will automatically refresh data on startup and provide a manual refresh button for users to trigger data updates.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Easy Deployment Without MongoDB Installation
**As an** IT Administrator
**I want to** deploy the RFQ Dashboard using Docker Compose
**So that** I can avoid complex MongoDB installation procedures and ensure consistent deployment across environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single `docker-compose up` command starts the entire application
- MongoDB runs in a container with persistent data storage
- No manual MongoDB installation required on host system
- Application automatically connects to containerized MongoDB

### Story 2: Automatic Data Refresh on Startup
**As a** Dashboard User
**I want** the application to automatically refresh RFQ data when it starts
**So that** I always see the most current information when accessing the dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Crawler executes automatically when Streamlit app container starts
- Data is refreshed before the dashboard UI becomes available
- Startup process completes successfully even if crawler encounters errors
- Logs indicate successful data refresh on startup

### Story 3: Manual Data Refresh via UI
**As a** Dashboard User
**I want to** manually trigger a data refresh using a button in the UI
**So that** I can update the displayed information without restarting the application

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Refresh button is prominently displayed in the dashboard UI
- Clicking refresh triggers the crawler in the background
- Status notification shows refresh is in progress
- Success/failure notification appears when refresh completes
- Dashboard data updates automatically after successful refresh

### Story 4: Network Deployment
**As an** IT Administrator
**I want to** deploy the dashboard on the office network
**So that** multiple users can access it from their workstations via WiFi

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application is accessible on port 8501 across the office network
- Configuration allows binding to network interface
- Multiple concurrent users can access the dashboard
- Deployment documentation includes network configuration steps

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Dockerfile for Streamlit application
   - docker-compose.yml orchestrating app and MongoDB services
   - Multi-stage build optimization (if applicable)
   - Health checks for containers

2. **Volume Mounts**
   - Projects folder mounted read-only for file access
   - config.json mounted as volume for easy configuration updates
   - MongoDB data volume for persistent storage
   - Proper volume permissions and ownership

3. **Application Integration**
   - Startup crawler execution on container initialization
   - UI refresh button implementation in Streamlit
   - Background job handling for manual refresh
   - Status notifications for refresh operations

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variables for flexible configuration
   - MongoDB connection string configuration
   - Port configuration for network deployment
   - Host interface binding configuration

5. **Documentation**
   - Deployment instructions for Windows host
   - Volume mount configuration guide
   - Network deployment setup
   - Windows Task Scheduler integration approach
   - Troubleshooting common issues

## Out of Scope

1. **Cloud Deployment**
   - AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud hosting
   - Container registry publishing
   - Cloud-specific orchestration (ECS, AKS, GKE)

2. **Advanced Orchestration**
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Auto-scaling configuration
   - Load balancing across multiple instances

3. **CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Automated build pipelines
   - Automated testing in containers
   - Automated deployment workflows

4. **Authentication & Security**
   - User authentication system
   - HTTPS/TLS certificate configuration
   - Advanced security hardening beyond basic practices

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Centralized logging aggregation
   - Monitoring dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Alert configuration

## Expected Deliverable

### Primary Deliverables
1. **Dockerfile**
   - Based on python:3.12-slim
   - Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Runs as non-root user for security
   - Includes health check configuration

2. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Defines `app` and `mongodb` services
   - Configures named volumes for persistence
   - Sets up internal Docker network
   - Exposes port 8501 for dashboard access
   - Includes environment variable configuration

3. **Modified streamlit_dashboard.py**
   - Executes crawler on application startup
   - Implements refresh button in UI
   - Handles background refresh jobs
   - Displays status notifications

4. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Volume mount configuration guide
   - Network deployment setup for office WiFi
   - Windows Task Scheduler integration guide
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Success Criteria
- Application starts successfully with `docker-compose up`
- Dashboard displays current RFQ data after startup
- Users can manually refresh data via UI button
- MongoDB data persists across container restarts
- Configuration changes in config.json take effect without rebuilding
- Projects folder files are accessible to the application
- Multiple users can access dashboard on office network
