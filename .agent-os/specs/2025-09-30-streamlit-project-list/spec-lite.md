# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a Streamlit-based project list sidebar to replace the PyQt6 desktop version, enabling web browser access for the entire team on the local work network. Features include real-time search/filter by project number, sort options (by number, date, last scanned), project selection state management, and network accessibility configuration (0.0.0.0 binding) so team members can access from any workstation browser.
