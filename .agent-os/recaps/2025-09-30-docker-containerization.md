# [2025-09-30] Recap: Docker Containerization

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-docker-containerization/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully containerized the RFQ Dashboard application using Docker Compose to eliminate MongoDB installation complexity and enable easy deployment across office networks. The implementation packages both the Streamlit application and MongoDB database in containers with proper data persistence, automatic startup refresh, and manual refresh capabilities. All 24 tasks were completed (100%), delivering a production-ready containerized solution with comprehensive documentation.

Key deliverables:

- **Docker Configuration**: Created Dockerfile based on python:3.12-slim with non-root user security, health checks, and optimized dependency installation. Implemented docker-compose.yml orchestrating both app and MongoDB services with proper networking and dependencies.

- **Volume Management**: Configured persistent storage for MongoDB data using named volumes, read-only mount for projects folder access, and read-write mount for config.json to enable configuration updates without container rebuilds.

- **Startup Crawler**: Implemented automatic data refresh on application startup with timeout handling (5 minutes), error recovery, and user-friendly status notifications to ensure dashboard displays current information immediately.

- **Manual Refresh Feature**: Added refresh button in the UI with background thread processing to prevent blocking, comprehensive status notifications (success/warning/error/timeout), and proper session state management for concurrent users.

- **Network Deployment**: Configured application to bind to 0.0.0.0:8501 for office network access, created PowerShell automation script (refresh-rfq-data.ps1) for scheduled data refreshes, and documented Windows Firewall configuration.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created three documentation files:
  - README.md: Quick start guide and basic troubleshooting
  - DEPLOYMENT.md: Detailed deployment instructions for Windows including Docker Desktop installation, volume configuration, network setup, and Task Scheduler integration
  - TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Common issues and solutions covering container logs, volume mounts, network connectivity, and MongoDB connection errors

- **Testing & Validation**: Verified all functionality including end-to-end deployment, data persistence across container restarts, configuration updates without rebuilds, MongoDB data integrity, and proper network binding configuration.

## Context

Containerize the RFQ Dashboard application using Docker Compose to enable easy deployment and solve MongoDB installation complexity issues. The solution will package the Streamlit application and MongoDB database in containers with proper volume mounts for configuration, project data access, and persistent database storage. The system will automatically refresh data on startup and provide a manual refresh button for users to trigger data updates.
