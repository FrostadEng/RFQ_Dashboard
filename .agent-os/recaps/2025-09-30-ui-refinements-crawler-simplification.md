# [2025-09-30] Recap: UI Refinements and Crawler Simplification

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-30-ui-refinements-crawler-simplification/spec.md.

## Recap

This spec simplified the RFQ tracking system by removing ZIP file complexity and unifying the data model for better scalability and maintainability. The implementation consolidated the separate transmissions and receipts collections into a single submissions collection with a type field, eliminated ZIP file processing logic in favor of folder-based tracking, set dark mode as the default UI theme, and made project numbers clickable to open the corresponding folder in the file explorer.

Key accomplishments:
- Unified submissions model reduces database complexity and simplifies queries
- Simplified crawler logic with a single `process_submission_folder()` method replacing separate sent/received processing
- Dark mode enabled by default for improved visual comfort
- Enhanced UX with clickable project numbers linking to file explorer
- Updated mock projects to folder-based structure with descriptive date-based naming
- Consistent UI display for both sent and received submissions using folder trees

## Context

Simplify RFQ crawler by removing ZIP file support and treating Sent/Received folders identically (folder-based only). Update UI with dark mode default and clickable project number that opens folder in file explorer. Unify transmissions and receipts into single `submissions` collection with `type` field ("sent"/"received"). Update mock projects and dashboard to display simplified structure, supporting multiple sent/received exchanges per supplier for tracking ongoing negotiations.
