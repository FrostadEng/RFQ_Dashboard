         8 +  ## Summary
         9 +  
        10 +  Successfully redesigned the RFQ Dashboard with an improved three-panel layout featuring enhanced navigation, hierarchical supplier organization, in-browser file preview, and comprehensive statistics. Updated the crawler to handle 
           + the real network path pattern with "1-RFQ" prefix and "Supplier RFQ Quotes" intermediate directory layer.

        76 +  
        77 +  ### Database Schema
        78 +  ```javascript
        79 +  // Projects collection
        80 +  {
        81 +    project_number: String,
        82 +    project_path: String,
        83 +    last_scanned: ISODate
        84 +  }
        85 +  
        86 +  // Suppliers collection
        87 +  {
        88 +    project_number: String,
        89 +    supplier_name: String,
        90 +    supplier_path: String
        91 +  }
        92 +  
        93 +  // Submissions collection
        94 +  {
        95 +    project_number: String,
        96 +    supplier_name: String,
        97 +    type: "sent" | "received",
        98 +    folder_name: String,
        99 +    folder_path: String (unique),
       100 +    date: ISODate,
       101 +    files: [String],
       102 +    last_scanned: ISODate
       103 +  }
       104 +  ```
       105 +  
       106 +  ## User-Facing Improvements
       107 +  
       108 +  1. **Better Navigation** - Dedicated panels for projects and suppliers with clear visual hierarchy
       109 +  2. **Comprehensive Filtering** - Search, supplier filter, and date range for quick access
       110 +  3. **Version Tracking** - Multiple versions of same folder grouped with history display
       111 +  4. **Statistics Visibility** - File counts and sizes at supplier and folder levels
       112 +  5. **In-Browser Preview** - No need to download files to check contents
       113 +  6. **Professional UI** - Dark mode theme, loading indicators, clear visual feedback
       114 +  7. **Flexible Path Support** - Works with both old and new folder structures
       115 +  
       116 +  ## Migration Notes
       117 +  
       118 +  - **Path Pattern Change**: Crawler now supports `1-RFQ/Supplier RFQ Quotes/` intermediate layers
       119 +  - **Backward Compatible**: Old folder structures still work without migration
       120 +  - **Mock Data Updated**: Development/testing data reflects real network structure
       121 +  - **No Schema Changes**: Database structure unchanged, only path patterns updated
       122 +  
       123 +  ## Success Metrics
       124 +  
       125 +  ✅ All 6 task groups completed (43 subtasks)
       126 +  ✅ Crawler handles new folder structure with intermediate layers
       127 +  ✅ Three-panel layout with enhanced navigation
       128 +  ✅ Search, filters, pagination, and sorting functional
       129 +  ✅ File preview supports PDF, images, and text files
       130 +  ✅ Statistics displayed throughout UI

       132 +  ✅ End-to-end workflow tested and verified
       133 +  
       134 +  ## Next Steps
       135 +  
       136 +  This spec is complete and the dashboard is production-ready. The improved UI and updated folder structure support provide a solid foundation for:
       137 +  - Dashboard refactoring into modular structure (New Spec: 2025-10-02)
       138 +  - Configuration enhancement for flexible folder patterns (Roadmap Phase 1.3)
       139 +  - Advanced analytics and reporting (Roadmap Phase 3)
